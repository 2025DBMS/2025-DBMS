1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
Next, we'll demonstrate
the smart search mode in action.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,800
This is the simple interface we've created.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Beyond standard keyword searches,
users can switch to another tab
for our 'Smart Search' feature.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,800
Here, users can type their
preferences in natural language.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For instance: "An apartment in Banqiao
with AC and a washing machine,
pet-friendly, around 20 pings."

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
After hitting search...

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,500
...the system quickly parses this input
into database-supported filters
like district (Banqiao), size,

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,000
and amenities,
then returns matching results.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,500
Another powerful feature is
similarity search using images.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's demonstrate the image mode.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Users can upload a photo
of a room they like...

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,000
...for example, this one.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
After searching,

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,000
the results shown are visually
similar to the uploaded reference image.

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,000
Notice they often feature similar elements
like sofas, small tables,
and comparable lighting styles.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,000
This particular listing might not seem
like a perfect match at first glance
from its cover image.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,500
However, listings often
have multiple photos.

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,500
Clicking through, we can see
this interior shot is much closer
to our reference!

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,500
Thank you for watching our demo!
